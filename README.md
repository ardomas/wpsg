# WPSG — Wonder Pieces Simple Gear

WPSG is a lightweight and modular WordPress enhancement toolkit.  
It provides a collection of small, practical features designed to support site builders, educators, community projects, and anyone who needs simple tools without unnecessary complexity.

This project aims to grow slowly and carefully, focusing on clarity, stability, and practical value. Each feature inside WPSG is built to be:

- **Modular** — tools are separated cleanly and can evolve independently.  
- **Simple** — minimal design, readable code, and easy to maintain.  
- **Helpful** — built to solve real needs in real projects.  
- **Expandable** — new tools can be added naturally over time.

At the moment, WPSG contains only the base structure.  
More tools will be added as the project grows, such as formatting utilities, announcements, profile sections, and other small gears that support everyday WordPress development.

Thank you for exploring or using WPSG.  
This project is developed with dedication, curiosity, and the spirit of continuous improvement.
