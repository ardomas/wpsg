# WPSG — Wonder Pieces in Simple Gear

> **“Lightweight tools, powerful results.”**  

WPSG is a lightweight WordPress plugin that provides a curated set of tools:  
simple, easy-to-use, yet highly effective. Designed to streamline developers' workflow,  
WPSG combines **simplicity**, **efficiency**, and **practical power** in a single package.

This project aims to grow **slowly and carefully**, focusing on **clarity**, **stability**, and **practical value**. Each feature inside WPSG is built to be:

- **Modular** — tools are separated cleanly and can evolve independently.  
- **Simple** — minimal design, readable code, and easy to maintain.  
- **Helpful** — built to solve real needs in real projects.  
- **Expandable** — new tools can be added naturally over time.

At the moment, WPSG contains only the **base structure**.  
More tools will be added as the project grows, such as:

- Formatting utilities  
- Announcements  
- Profile sections  
- Other small gears that support everyday WordPress development
